# Entropic Filament Theory

**Emergent gravity as entropy gradients in weighted random graphs.**

This project explores a novel framework for modeling gravitational attraction not as a geometric property of spacetime, but as a result of entropic flows through information networks. Mass is treated as a local disruption of entropy flow in a weighted graph, and gravitational effects arise as statistical gradients of energy potential.

## 🌐 What is it?

- A numerical simulation of emergent gravity on random graphs.
- Mass is modeled as increased resistance (weight) at a node.
- Entropic potential is calculated via a Laplacian system.
- Distance from mass node correlates strongly with energy gradient ΔE.
